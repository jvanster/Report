With their adult responsibilities and busy schedules it can be tough getting a full nights rest when they have that early class. It's just something I have been thinking about. I think it is especially relevant for the 7:45am time slot. ",4,3,3,4,3,3,Very open,"I think this approach is actually ideal for the modern student. Now more than ever, students want to gain real-world practical experience and to build skills that are applicable to their future professions. It could be argued that classes structured this way could be more beneficial to students compared to traditional lecture courses or teacher-centered education. These course options could help us move to a student-centered learning environment. ",Very opposed,"I commute and I teach classes on the first time slot of everyday. So that means I wake up at 5am-5:30 am every day to get here on time. I am also much more of a night person, so I do not mind the later classes. As I mentioned previously, students seem to be less engaged, more tired, and are often absent from the early classes on average. ",Option 1,Somewhat disagree,-,5,0,0,0,5,

The proposed changes on Option 1 would either:
1. Have our students start earlier in the day (1:25pm) necessitating more time taken off work and having increased ""down time"" between class blocks (4:25-6:00pm), OR
2. Require students to attend class from 2:40-9:00pm with only a 10-minute break between class blocks, or stay until 10:00pm in the evening if the second class block was moved back to start at 7:00pm to give them a dinner break.
